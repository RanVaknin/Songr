my app has 4 different routes:

- localhost:8080/hello - this path would return a hello world message to the user. User can specify a query parameter to get a custom hello message. for example. /hello?name=John.

- /capitalize route. get a custom capitalized message in the path extention of your choice- for example /capitalize/CUSTOM MESSAGE.

- / route splash page with a button to direct you to:

- /albums path, show albums and information rendering from a hard coded array of Albums.

- you are able to add and remove songs to an existing albums and it will be updated in the database.
